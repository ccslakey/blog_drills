#DRILL 1
*Time goal: 2hrs

##The Good
1.Met all basic requirements for logging in
	(but who wants to be basic anyways)

2.No CRUD unless you're logged in

3.1hr,33min 

##The not so good
1.Can't edit articles

2.no navbar, partials for edit, view

3.Validations? very funny

4.Had to refer back to earlier excercises for help with logic. Is this bad?

5. So very plain. Go for more reqs next time, take longer if need be


####Overall: 3/5 (good speed, very barebones)

*next one: Take more time, complete some more functionality and icing!



# DRILL 2
*Time goal: 1hr (I know I said I'd take longer but I was feeling lazy and just wanted to go fast)


##Good


1. Got rid of unnecessary Sites resources

2. Rendered articles in a show page

3. FAST: 45 minutes


##Bad

1. Stretch goals? Could've shot for the moon on this one, I had a lot of time extra to do so

2. Several typos, but it only took about 5 minutes to find them all so I'm not super upset

####Overall: 4/5 (2fast 2 furious 4 u, slightly more barebones)
