#DRILL 1
*Time goal: 2hrs

##The Good
*Met all basic requirements for logging in
	(but who wants to be basic anyways)
*No CRUD unless you're logged in
*1hr,33min 8)

##The not so good
*Can't edit articles
*no navbar, partials for edit, view
*Validations? very funny
*Had to refer back to earlier excercises for help with logic. Is this bad?


*overall: 3/5 (good speed, very barebones)
*next one: Take more time, complete some more functionality and icing!
